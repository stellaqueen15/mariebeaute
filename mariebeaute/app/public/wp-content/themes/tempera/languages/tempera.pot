msgid ""
"We had to follow a very strict recipe to get Tempera just right. We started "
"with a very solid framework of over 200 settings, added a very light user "
"interface, threw in a couple of mobiles and tablets to give it that "
"responsive elasticity, added over 50 fonts, weren't satisfied so we poured "
"all the Google fonts into the mix, then scattered 12 widget areas for "
"consistency, dissolved a slider and unlimited columns into a customizable "
"Presentation Page then mixed it in as well. We then sprinkled all post "
"formats, 8 layouts including magazine and blog, powdered 40+ social icons "
"and even blended in a customizable top bar for extra density. We also made "
"it translation ready and gave it RTL language support for some cultural "
"diversity. The secret ingredient was love and we might've spilled too much "
"of that. But now Tempera has just the right feel and the right texture and "
"is exactly what your empty WordPress canvas needs. NEW! Tempera now comes in "
"16 different flavors with preset color schemes!"
